# Tornado-PyRoaring-Project

Task overview: 

Your task is to create a microservice with a tornado API endpoint that you will design using the bitmap roaring implementation in python that you can find here (https://github.com/Ezibenroc/PyRoaringBitMap).

We need tests that will test the following use cases:

session management: how many users have not log in for a week?
user tagging with tags (tag1....tag10) and answer to the question: how many users have tag1 and tag2, what are the ids of users with tag1
load test for 1000 concurrent sessions
The purpose of the task is not necessarily to complete it. You can also send us some partial solution. What we want to see is how you perceive and manage a new and potentially unknown object or technology.
